I wander over flooded lands, watching the memories of lost ones in the pools of murky water. I reach out and scoop them up in my cupped hands. They?re liquid velvet on my skin. I tiptoe over the charred remains of forests '),
	(2,'Amelie Clayden','School Name 2','2006-01-01 00:00:00','female','The Big Yellow Frilly Knickers','It was a bad day for hair, but a great day for drying washing. The wind was whistling at the windows and drumming at the doors. A jolly woman wearing a flowery dress and a blue scarf in her hair rushed outside with a basket full of wet washing. Fumbling with the pegs she attempted to hang it on the wavy washing line as fast as she could. Shorts, trousers, t-shirts and one pair of big yellow frilly knickers were dancing on the line, as though they were at a disco.A big gust of wind that seemed to echo across the land blew at the washing. The shirts whizzed round and round, the trousers looked like they were running away and the big yellow frilly knickers blew clean off the line and into the town ahead. It happened so, on that very day, a young man was proposing to his girlfriend at Luigi?s restaurant in the town square. As the man reached for the engagement ring and opened his mouth for his well prepared speech, the big yellow frilly knickers landed on the ring. It was as if he was suggesting that his girlfriend wore the knickers as a token of her love for him. Horrified, the girlfriend fled in tears with the young man trailing after her. The big yellow frilly knickers flew on down the street. Meanwhile a nosey old man was driving his little brown car, his head poking over the steering wheel. The old man opened his window and squeezed his head through the gap to look at a chef running after the young man who had left his restaurant without paying. The old man popped his head back in to find the big yellow frilly knickers had landed on his windscreen. He began swinging his head side to side, ducking and reaching, trying to see the road ahead. He flicked on the windscreen wipers and the big yellow frilly knickers screeched across the windscreen, until they pinged off and landed on the young man?s face. In fact, the force of the big yellow frilly knickers was so fierce, that it knocked the young man to the ground. The wind was beginning to drop and it was as though the big yellow frilly knickers knew they had to get home. They drifted through the sky like dandelion seeds. They got caught briefly on the jolly woman?s TV aerial which interrupted her dog training programme, but prompted her into the garden to collect her washing. One last breeze carried the big yellow frilly knickers down and gently back onto the peg they had blown free from. Home not just in time for dinner, not just in time for tea, but just in time to be collected in and put back in the drawer with the rest of the big frilly knickers. Oh, as for the young man. He settled his bill before finding his girlfriend, who eventually said yes (but not to big yellow frilly knickers!'),
	(3,'Rhys Mulligan','School Name 3Ish','2006-01-01 00:00:00','male','Different Dad','I always thought my Dad was different from other Dads. To look at he seemed quite normal. He had two eyes a nose and mouth, just like most Dads. But I sensed there was something strange, something special about him. All I knew was that he worked for the army on secret stuff but he wasn?t allowed to talk about it.\nI?m not a naughty boy, but whenever I did anything that was a little bit naughty my Dad always caught me. He even caught me when he wasn?t even in the same room as me! I never saw him eat either. Whenever we ate tea he always rushed off to the garage straight after. He said he was going to fix his old motorbike. He has been fixing this motorbike for the last 7 years. As long as I can remember because I am 7 years old!!!\nLast week was Sports Day in our school, and this was when the strangest thing happened. We have a Dad?s Race unfortunately. I say unfortunately because I had never seen my Dad run or even jog before. I knew he would come last in the race and that would really embarrass me in front of all my friends. I had asked him not to sign up for it but he always does the opposite of what I tell him to do. On Monday it was Dad?s Race. Dad went over to the starting line, ready steady? go. To my amazement Dad was in the lead then I couldn?t see him. He was running faster than a cheetah but suddenly he tripped over and fell with a TREMENDOUS CRASH! I ran over to him and he wasn?t moving. His eyes were wide open but he didn?t blink. A crowd of people gathered around him and someone said he wasn?t breathing. Before I knew it an ambulance had come and they put him on a stretcher and took him away. Just before they closed the doors I saw something very weird. The inside of the ambulance was full of computers and I thought I saw them push a thick cable into my dad?s ear!\nIt was two days before dad came home again and no one had really explained anything to me. After tea dad disappeared off to the garage again and I decided to sneakily follow him. I had questions that needed answering. I hid behind the lawnmower and watched him set to work. Dad got his toolkit out but to my amazement he didn?t go over to his motorbike. He got a screwdriver out and put it in his ear. After a few turns his head popped off and lots of wires dangled out. He connected his head to a secret computer inside his workbench and started to upload files. My dad was a robot spy!');
