	(1,4,'Forget-Me-Not','I?m the memory collector. I?ve met you, but you haven?t met me.\n\nI was once like you, living, breathing, warm. I?d play with my friends on the beach, in the park, I?d laugh, talk, I?d enjoy life.\n\nWell, I did.\n\nI collect the memories of everyone, even those who cease to exist. I wander over flooded lands, watching the memories of lost ones in the pools of murky water. I reach out and scoop them up in my cupped hands. They?re liquid velvet on my skin. I tiptoe over the charred remains of forests '),
	(2,5,'The Big Yellow Frilly Knickers','It was a bad day for hair, but a great day for drying washing. The wind was whistling at the windows and drumming at the doors. A jolly woman wearing a flowery dress and a blue scarf in her hair rushed outside with a basket full of wet washing. Fumbling with the pegs she attempted to hang it on the wavy washing line as fast as she could. Shorts, trousers, t-shirts and one pair of big yellow frilly knickers were dancing on the line, as though they were at a disco.A big gust of wind that seemed to echo across the land blew at the washing. The shirts whizzed round and round, the trousers looked like they were running away and the big yellow frilly knickers blew clean off the line and into the town ahead. It happened so, on that very day, a young man was proposing to his girlfriend at Luigi?s restaurant in the town square. As the man reached for the engagement ring and opened his mouth for his well prepared speech, the big yellow frilly knickers landed on the ring. It was as if he was suggesting that his girlfriend wore the knickers as a token of her love for him. Horrified, the girlfriend fled in tears with the young man trailing after her. The big yellow frilly knickers flew on down the street. Meanwhile a nosey old man was driving his little brown car, his head poking over the steering wheel. The old man opened his window and squeezed his head through the gap to look at a chef running after the young man who had left his restaurant without paying. The old man popped his head back in to find the big yellow frilly knickers had landed on his windscreen. He began swinging his head side to side, ducking and reaching, trying to see the road ahead. He flicked on the windscreen wipers and the big yellow frilly knickers screeched across the windscreen, until they pinged off and landed on the young man?s face. In fact, the force of the big yellow frilly knickers was so fierce, that it knocked the young man to the ground. The wind was beginning to drop and it was as though the big yellow frilly knickers knew they had to get home. They drifted through the sky like dandelion seeds. They got caught briefly on the jolly woman?s TV aerial which interrupted her dog training programme, but prompted her into the garden to collect her washing. One last breeze carried the big yellow frilly knickers down and gently back onto the peg they had blown free from. Home not just in time for dinner, not just in time for tea, but just in time to be collected in and put back in the drawer with the rest of the big frilly knickers. Oh, as for the young man. He settled his bill before finding his girlfriend, who eventually said yes (but not to big yellow frilly knickers!'),
	(3,6,'Different Dad','I always thought my Dad was different from other Dads. To look at he seemed quite normal. He had two eyes a nose and mouth, just like most Dads. But I sensed there was something strange, something special about him. All I knew was that he worked for the army on secret stuff but he wasn?t allowed to talk about it.\nI?m not a naughty boy, but whenever I did anything that was a little bit naughty my Dad always caught me. He even caught me when he wasn?t even in the same room as me! I never saw him eat either. Whenever we ate tea he always rushed off to the garage straight after. He said he was going to fix his old motorbike. He has been fixing this motorbike for the last 7 years. As long as I can remember because I am 7 years old!!!\nLast week was Sports Day in our school, and this was when the strangest thing happened. We have a Dad?s Race unfortunately. I say unfortunately because I had never seen my Dad run or even jog before. I knew he would come last in the race and that would really embarrass me in front of all my friends. I had asked him not to sign up for it but he always does the opposite of what I tell him to do. On Monday it was Dad?s Race. Dad went over to the starting line, ready steady? go. To my amazement Dad was in the lead then I couldn?t see him. He was running faster than a cheetah but suddenly he tripped over and fell with a TREMENDOUS CRASH! I ran over to him and he wasn?t moving. His eyes were wide open but he didn?t blink. A crowd of people gathered around him and someone said he wasn?t breathing. Before I knew it an ambulance had come and they put him on a stretcher and took him away. Just before they closed the doors I saw something very weird. The inside of the ambulance was full of computers and I thought I saw them push a thick cable into my dad?s ear!\nIt was two days before dad came home again and no one had really explained anything to me. After tea dad disappeared off to the garage again and I decided to sneakily follow him. I had questions that needed answering. I hid behind the lawnmower and watched him set to work. Dad got his toolkit out but to my amazement he didn?t go over to his motorbike. He got a screwdriver out and put it in his ear. After a few turns his head popped off and lots of wires dangled out. He connected his head to a secret computer inside his workbench and started to upload files. My dad was a robot spy!'),
	(4,6,'Life Through a lens','I was born when a human pulled me out of my packaging. I heard rustling, crumpling and eager voices shrieking: \"Don\"\'\"t forget to read the instructions!\" Initially my ears were alive with sounds but I saw nothing. Then suddenly my lens cap was removed and I could see. Movement and shapes preceded vivid colours. As I looked round, I stopped and focused on an adorable little human in a larger being?s arms. I blinked in a suffusion of light and the moment was captured forever.\n\nSometimes I was asked to record moving picture and sound. I saw the little human?\'?s first tooth, and witnessed his first step and recorded his first word. I started to feel ? yes, actually feel - warmth every time I winked at him. I loved him so much, even when he smothered me in chocolate spread! He became a child then an adolescent and an adult. His whole life was recorded in my memory. His name was George.\n\nI travelled the world with George and his family capturing their laughs and experiences. I was treasured.\n\nWhen I saw George leave for university I experienced my first negative emotion. I was angry and upset that education was so important to humans that they sent their children away from home. I sulked in my box for 5 long years.\n\nThe next time I blinked, I saw a handsome young George with a beautiful woman wearing a long white dress. I recorded many happy memories of them and one day a tiny human appeared in their arms. With immense pride I recorded these words.\n?This is our new born son, Charlie. He weighs seven pounds.\"\n\nI fell asleep for a few years but my dreams were vivid. I relived all my memories, feeling, seeing, and hearing everything as if for the first time. When I woke up I was overwhelmed with excitement. I knew it was George?\'?s fortieth birthday and I couldn?\'?t wait to see him. I was pulled out of my case but before long I felt wet drops land on me even though there was no rain. Where was George? I knew his warm gentle hands, but they weren?\'?t holding me. I opened my eye as wide as I could - still no George. Then I saw it - a Union Jack on a long wooden box being placed into a hole in the ground. A cold grey stone protruded from the earth. My George was dead. I felt as if all the mechanisms inside me were ripped out. I felt as if my lens was shattered. I wanted to be dead but I wasn?\'?t. I could still feel, and it hurt. I closed my eyes and saw nothing again for many decades.\n\nSuddenly I woke up to see faces leering and fingers pointing at me through a glass screen. I had outlived four generations and I found myself in a museum. The title of the display was ?\'?Objects that were once useful?\'?.');
